# Analyzing-Expected-vs-Actual-Betting-Odds
An in depth analysis of implied odds vs the true odds of betting on a sportsbook

## Background
While the Coronavirus Pandemic has affected nearly all aspects of our lives, the impact that this virus will have on state budgets will be felt for years to come.  One of the easiest ways to raise tax revenue is to legalize sports betting, a trend that has been slowly making its way through the United States.  As of now, 18 states have legalized sports betting, 4 more have legalized it and will be operational by the end of 2020, and more states are discussing legalization.  Nearly every state has discussed a sports betting bill, and the need for more tax revenue will accelerate the legalization process in the years to come.

With a new industry emerging, there are new possibilities to make profit off of these sportsbooks.  The number of professional sports betters is increasing dramatically, as they look for a way to profit off of sportsbooks.  These betters attempt to analyze thousands of datapoints in order to create more efficient algorithms to predict game scores than the oddsmakers in Vegas.  If they succeeed, there is an incredible amount of profit.  If they do not, they waste hundreds of hours of time, resources, and money.  This project will not attempt to replicate the predictive models of professional sports betters, but it will instead analyze just how difficult it is to make a profit off of sportsbooks.
